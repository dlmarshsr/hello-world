# hello-world

Tops!

Cali here, getting started with github and my coding career! Just graduated a 3-month Full Stack Java bootcamp looking for entry level positions. I'd love to work in gaming or entertainment. I'm an Air Force vet, husband and father or 3 boys. When I'm not coding I'm making music or playing basketball. I would love to collaborate on a project with you!
